# Grafana, Graphite & StatsD with Ansible

This playbook let you easily setup [Grafana](http://grafana.org/), [Graphite](http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and [StatsD](https://github.com/etsy/statsd/).
You can use it to provison a dedicated server or even a virtual machine using the VagrantFile and Virtualbox

It uses [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/) as a provisionner, make sure to install Ansible before (version >= 1.6).

What gets installed with this playbook:
*  PostgreSQL
*  NginX webserver/reverse proxy
*  Python & Pip
*  NodeJS
*  Memcached
*  StatsD
*  Grahite with its components:
	* [Carbon](https://github.com/graphite-project/carbon)
	* [Whisper](https://github.com/graphite-project/whisper)
	* [The Graphite webapp](https://github.com/graphite-project/graphite-web)
* And finally [Grafana](http://grafana.org/)


## Setup

Before running this playbook you need to configure a few things, mostly **for security purposes**.
All the configuration variables are defined in the _playbook.yml_ file, I suggest you to take a look at each of them.

Global:
- _user_: By default Vagrant will use the user "vagrant".

Here the most important one for **Graphite**:
- _graphite.secret_key_: This is the django secret signin key, generate your own [here](http://www.miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/)
- _graphite.nginx_server_name_: The domain or IP address on which you will access graphite
- _graphite.nginx_htpasswd_: The .htaccess content, you can generate one from [here](http://htpasswd.i-connector.com/) (by default the login/pass is admin/admin).
- _graphite.nginx_enable_ssl_: Wherever or not you want to use SSL, I **strongly** advise you to do so if you don't your credential will be sent in clear mode
- _graphite.nginx_ssl_cert_: If you enable the SSL you need an SSL certificate (.crt or .pem), use the name of it here and add it inside the /files/ssl directory
- _nginx_ssl_key_: If you enable the SSL you need an SSL certificate (.key), use the name of it here and add it inside the /ssl directroy

Here the most important one for **Grafana**:
- _grafana_version_: The version of Grafana to use, check for the latest one
- _grafana_nginx_server_name_: The domain or IP address on which you will access grafana
- _grafana_nginx_htpasswd_: The .htaccess content, you can generate one from [here](http://htpasswd.i-connector.com/) (by default the login/pass is admin/admin).
- _grafana_nginx_enable_ssl_: Wherever or not you want to use SSL, I **strongly** advise you to do so if you don't your credential will be sent in clear mode
- _grafana_nginx_ssl_cert_: If you enable the SSL you need an SSL certificate (.crt or .pem), use the name of it here and add it inside the /files/ssl directory
- _grafana_nginx_ssl_key_: If you enable the SSL you need an SSL certificate (.key), use the name of it here and add it inside the /ssl directroy


In order to **restrict who can send data to StatsD** the only way to do it is by using a Firewall and restrict the access to StatsD port 8125. You will find at the end of the _playbook.yml_ two commented lines in order for you to do so using the UFW Firewall *(I recommend to disable all access to port 8125 except for IPs you trust)*.

After that you will be able to access:
- **StatsD**: http://your_box_ip_or_domain:8125 (Using UDP)
- **Graphite**: http://graphite.nginx_server_name:8082
- **Grafana**: http://grafana_nginx_server_name


## Running it with Vagrant

If you want to install Grafana/Graphite on a VM using Vagrant, you need to install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) first.

Then hit:
```
$ vagrant up
```

## Deploying with Ansible

Before running Ansible **you have to add the IP address of your target server into the _ansible_hosts_ file**.
```
$ vi ansible_hosts
```

You also need to **change the _remote_user_ variable** in _playbook.yml_ to the actual user you will use to login into your target server:

```
$ ansible-playbook -v -i ansible_hosts playbook.yml -e target=X.X.X.X
```

Also if you are **deploying to Ubuntu**, since you won't be able to login as root, you need to pass the *--sudo -K* option:
```
$ ansible-playbook -v -i ansible_hosts playbook.yml -e target=X.X.X.X --sudo -K
```

*(You should be able to use "target" instead of X.X.X.X in the command line but right now it's not working)*


## Generating a self-signed SSL Certificate

If you don't own a valid SSL certificate you can still generate a self-signed on:
```
$ cd files/ssl ; openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ssl_certif.pem -out ssl_certif.pem -days 365 -nodes
```


## Thanks

This project is originally based on two playbook:
- Graphite playbook from [DandyDev](https://github.com/DandyDev) that you can find [here](https://github.com/DandyDev/graphite-statsd-ansible-vagrant)
- Grafana playbook from [Bobrik](https://github.com/bobrik) that you can find [here](https://github.com/bobrik/ansible-grafana)
